The goal for this tool is transforming a userâ€™s natural language prompt into a more structured prompt using your pre-set logic in a webpage that calls your running local LLM.
Currently it's simply using Ollama for the local LLM and Gradio for the webpage.
Undergoing work:\n
Using llama.cpp to support .gguf models.\n
Tailored webpage.
